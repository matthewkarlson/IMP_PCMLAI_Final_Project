# My Final Project Submission for The Imperial Professional Certificate in Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence
This project is based on the example notebook from the Kaggle competion here: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview")

I conduct an initial exploration of the data in the initial_exploration.ipynb file where I inspect the features of the dataset and construct perform some analysis like PCA.
