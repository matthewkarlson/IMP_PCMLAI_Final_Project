# House Price Prediction Project

## NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF YOUR PROJECT
This project aims to predict house prices using advanced machine learning models. By analyzing features like location, size, and other property attributes, the goal is to create an accurate, data-driven tool for estimating house values. This can help buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions. The project evaluates different models to identify the best performing algorithm for this task.

## DATA
The dataset includes historical house sale prices and their features, sourced from [Kaggle's House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). Key features include property size, location, and condition. This dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and anomalies (e.g., many properties sold at $163,000).

## MODEL 
We tested multiple models:
1. **Linear Regression**: Used as a baseline but performed poorly due to the dataset's complexity.
2. **Random Forest Regressor**: Chosen for its robustness and ability to capture non-linear relationships.
3. **XGBoost Regressor**: Selected for its efficiency and superior performance after hyperparameter tuning.

XGBoost emerged as the best model, balancing accuracy and interpretability.

## HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMIZATION
Hyperparameters for Random Forest (e.g., number of trees, max depth) and XGBoost (e.g., learning rate, tree depth) were optimized using RandomizedSearchCV. This approach efficiently searched a predefined parameter space to minimize mean absolute error (MAE). 

## RESULTS
- **Linear Regression**: High MAE and RMSE, indicating poor fit to data.
- **Random Forest**: Significant improvement, reducing errors and increasing RÂ².
- **XGBoost**: Best performance with lowest MAE and RMSE, confirmed through cross-validation and validation sets.
