# Datasheet for Ames Housing Dataset

## Motivation

- **Purpose:** The dataset was created to provide a modern and comprehensive dataset for data science education, specifically for regression tasks related to housing prices.
- **Creators:** The dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock, a professor at Truman State University, for use in educational contexts.
- **Funding:** There is no specific funding information available; it was created as an academic resource.

## Composition

- **Instances:** The dataset comprises records of house sales in Ames, Iowa, with 1,460 rows in the training dataset and 291 rows in the test dataset.
- **Features:** The dataset includes 79 explanatory variables describing (1) the characteristics of residential homes in Ames and (2) sale prices as the target variable.
- **Missing Data:** Some features contain missing values (e.g., `LotFrontage`, `Alley`, and `PoolQC`), which have been addressed during preprocessing.
- **Confidentiality:** The dataset does not include any personally identifiable or confidential information, as it is based on publicly available housing data.

## Collection Process

- **Acquisition:** The data was collected from publicly available records in Ames, Iowa. It includes detailed real estate transaction records.
- **Sampling Strategy:** There is no specific sampling strategy mentioned; the dataset is a representation of residential real estate transactions in Ames.
- **Time Frame:** The data spans multiple years but focuses on transactions within Ames city limits. Exact years of data collection are not specified.

## Preprocessing/Cleaning/Labeling

- **Preprocessing:** Preprocessing steps include handling missing values (`NA` entries replaced with "None" or statistical imputations), encoding categorical variables, and ensuring data consistency.
- **Raw Data:** The raw dataset is publicly available as part of the Kaggle competition. The cleaned and processed data is derived for specific tasks.

## Uses

- **Potential Uses:**  
  - Predictive modeling for house prices using machine learning.  
  - Feature engineering and selection for regression tasks.  
  - Education and practice in data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- **Considerations for Future Use:**  
  - The dataset is specific to Ames, Iowa, and may not generalize to other locations.  
  - Distributions and relationships in the data may not reflect housing markets in other regions or time periods.  
  - Users should avoid stereotyping or biased analysis based on neighborhood or housing types.
- **Prohibited Uses:**  
  - The dataset should not be used for real-world decision-making without validation and updates to reflect current market trends.  
  - Avoid any use that may perpetuate bias or discrimination in housing-related contexts.

## Distribution

- **Current Distribution:** The dataset is distributed freely on Kaggle as part of the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" competition.  
- **Licensing:** The dataset is intended for educational purposes and is publicly accessible without specific licensing restrictions.

## Maintenance

- **Maintainers:** The dataset is maintained by Dean De Cock and is available on Kaggle for continued use in education and practice. Updates and corrections are handled as needed.

## Summary of Key Variables

- **MSSubClass:** Type of dwelling involved in the sale.  
- **Neighborhood:** Location within Ames city limits.  
- **OverallQual:** Overall material and finish quality of the house.  
- **GrLivArea:** Above-grade living area in square feet.  
- **SalePrice:** Target variable representing the house's sale price.

This dataset provides a rich resource for exploring regression techniques and housing market analysis.
